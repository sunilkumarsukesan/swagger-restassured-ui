Boundary Testing:
	1. Field Length Limits
		○ Verify if fields have maximum character limits (e.g., Name: 50 characters, Email: 100 characters).
		○ Test entering 1 character and maximum allowed characters.
		○ Try exceeding the character limits to see how the system reacts.
	2. Email Validation
		○ Test various email formats: 
			§ Valid: user@example.com, test.user@domain.co.in
			§ Invalid: user@.com, @domain.com, user@domain, user@@domain.com
	3. Password Complexity
		○ Verify if passwords meet security criteria (e.g., uppercase, lowercase, number, special character).
		○ Try weak passwords like 12345, password, and check validation messages.
Role-Based Testing:
	1. Different User Roles 
		○ Register as Admin, Guest, Member, or Moderator (if applicable).
		○ Ensure each role gets the correct permissions and UI elements during registration.
Cross-Browser & Device Testing:
	1. Browser Compatibility
		○ Test on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari to ensure consistency.
	2. Mobile Responsiveness
		○ Verify registration flow on mobile devices & tablets in portrait and landscape modes.
Error Handling & Alerts:
	1. Form Submission Without Filling Fields
		○ Ensure required field validation works correctly and shows proper messages.
	2. Error Message Consistency
		○ Confirm error messages are clear, specific, and user-friendly (e.g., "Email is invalid" instead of "Error 400").
Performance & Load Testing:
	1. Simultaneous Registrations
		○ Test multiple users registering at the same time to check system performance.
	2. Page Load Speed
	• Verify how fast the registration form loads under normal and high traffic.
